        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step One: </strong>Bring a large pot to a boil. Boil lasagna noodles 6-8 minutes until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water. Lay noodles flat and remove excess water with a paper towel.</li>
            <li><strong>Step Two: </strong><em>In a skillet,</em> brown the ground beef over medium-high heat. Add onion, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cook until there is no remaining pink color in beef. Drain any liquids and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Step Three: </strong>In a large bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, Romano cheese, 2 cups of spaghetti saucee, and the seasoned ground beef. Mix until well blended. <em>Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 C)</em></li>
            <li><strong>Step Four: </strong>Add a thin layer of spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of noodles lengthwise and a few noodles in the opposite direction. Pour in a generous layer of ricotta mixture on top of the noodles.
            Top the ricotta layer with fresh basil leaves. Add another layer of the noodles lengthwise. Spread on 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Add another thin layer of ricotta cheese. Add the last
        layer of noodles lengthwise. Top the noodles with the remaining spaghetti cheese, several more fresh basil leaves in an eye catching arrangement and top with the remaining mozzarella cheese (1/2 cup)</li>
            <li><strong>Step Five: </strong>Bake in a preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes. If the mozzarella cheese becomes too browned, loosely cover it with a piece of foil.</li>
